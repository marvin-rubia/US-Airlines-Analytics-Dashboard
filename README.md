# US Domestic Airline Flights Analytics 2005 to 2020
This is the final assignment of IBM's _Data Visualization with Python_ course.

## Problem
Using Plotly's Dash and Plotly Express, how can we create an interactive dashboard that reports the yearly performance and delays of US airlines? By having this analytics dashboard, we can improve the flight reliability of US airlines. And by doing so, we can enhance customer experience and satisfaction. 

## Plan 
We are going to use the dataset (in .csv format) provided by IBM, which contains real data on US Domestic Flights from 1987 to 2020, taken from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Then, we extract the 2005 to 2020 data (as per the course instruction) to visualize them in our dashboard.

## Expected dashboard
Here's a screenshot of my dashboard for the __Yearly Airline Performance Report__ for 2009.

And here's a screenshot for the __Yearly Airline Delay Report__ for the same year.

## The coding process: from data to dashboard
You can check how I coded the dashboard in the uploaded Jupyter Notebook. You can view it here on GitHub or download it to run in your Jupyter environment. I recommend running the Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, so you can produce the dashboard and interact with its dropdowns and graphs.

## I wrote an educational blog about this
